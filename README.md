## Introduction

### Linear Algebra's Role in Image Processing
Linear algebra serves as a foundational tool in image processing, bridging the gap between visual complexity and mathematical abstraction. With images represented as digital matrices, each pixel assigned a numerical value, linear algebra facilitates the analysis and manipulation of visual data. This matrix-centric paradigm underscores the close relationship between image processing and linear algebra, offering a systematic framework for computational manipulation and decoding intricate visual patterns.

### Previous Studies
Prior research has explored the application of linear algebra in various image-processing tasks, including color manipulation, image compression, filtering, and rotation. Notable studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of matrix operations in altering color balance, compressing images, and enhancing image quality. These studies have underscored the versatility and utility of linear algebra techniques in addressing diverse image processing challenges.

### Aim of the Study
This research aims to investigate the utilization of matrix operations in image processing and their impact on enhancing and manipulating image quality. Specifically, the study focuses on brightness adjustment, geometric transformations, flipping, and image inversion. By providing real-life examples for each operation, the research aims to highlight the integration of linear algebra concepts in advancing image processing analysis.

## Methodology

### Brightness Adjustment (Scalar Multiplication)
Brightness adjustment involves scalar multiplication, where each pixel's intensity is modified by a scalar factor. This operation influences contrast and brightness, allowing for fine-tuning of image aesthetics. The study employs numpy library functions to apply scalar multiplication and ensure pixel values remain within the valid intensity range.

### Image Rotation (Matrix Multiplication)
Image rotation is achieved through matrix multiplication, where a rotation matrix is applied to each pixel coordinate. This geometric transformation preserves object form while rotating the image by a specified angle. The study utilizes numpy library functions to create the rotation matrix and apply it to the image matrix, enabling flexible rotation according to the desired angle.

### Manipulating Orientation (Transpose Operation)
The transpose operation manipulates the orientation of pixel values within the image matrix, facilitating tasks such as image flipping and orientation adjustments. By transposing the image matrix, the study demonstrates how pixel arrangements can be altered to achieve different visual effects. Numpy library functions are utilized to perform the transpose operation efficiently.

### Inversion Operation
Image inversion involves changing the intensity of each pixel by subtracting its value from the maximum intensity value. This operation results in an inverted version of the original image, offering unique visual perspectives. The study employs numpy library functions to implement the inversion operation and visualize the inverted image.

## Results
